## Argument

_Sourced from the project [README](https://github.com/DiddiLeija/diddi-and-the-bugs/blob/main/README.md#introduction)._

> The Earth is under invasion. A fleet of giant bugs, bacteria, and viruses are
> outside of the planet.
>
> In the meantime, Diddi was developing a secret spacecraft. When his frineds told him of
> the invasion, he decided to visit the brilliant Dr. Chuck (a scientist, and also
> an old friend of Diddi). The doctor gave him the **L1-F3** experimental serum, that kills anything
> alive. That should destroy those bugs...
>
> To ensure that those bugs will be destroyed, Diddi modified his spacecraft to convert it into a
> starfighter that energizes the serum and shoot it. Then, he named the starfighter **Willpower**.
> Suddendly, the Willpower goes outside of the planet, to start the fight...

## Development story

<!-- Note: Special quotes from me (from never-released pages from my diary) are below! Take note! -->

Initially, the game started as a submission to [GameOff 2021](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2021).

> When the jam's theme was exposed ("BUG"), I was a bit confused. I just took my computer, and created
> a weird draft of an invasion game, but I dropped it fastly. Then, a few days later, I was chatting
> with a great friend of mine, and told her about my plans to join the GameOff. I showed her the theme,
> and then replied: "I'm thinking about a doctor who uses a laser to destroy viruses or something like
> that". Then, I said "Something like a space-themed shooter with bugs?". After that, the idea was born.

At November 1st, 2021, when the jam started, the design part of the game started. The first idea was to use
[Pygame](https://pygame.org), and actually the game started with Pygame stuff. But then, the game switched
to [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel), that modeled the retro style of the final game.

At November 25, 2021, the first functional shot of the game was ready. A few days later, the first distribution
of **Diddi and the bugs** was ready at [itch.io](https://diddileija.itch.io/diddi-and-the-bugs).

After the jam ended, the game ranked 278th from 526 submissions. Not an extraordinary position, though. After
that, the first "stable" release (1.0.0) was published.

> After 2 months of working, coding, rating and fixing, the end of the event has just come.
> Today, they published the results (see [here](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2021/results)). I know, my game
> is not on the first pages (he he)… It ranked 278th. Only 7 people rated. But I don’t feel bad – there were
> 530 entries on the jam :p

Then, Ramirez started to look for inputs, and followed by new contributors, he polished the game in two other
releases, 1.1.0 and 1.2.0.

There are plans to cut a 2.0.0 release with major changes. But we should wait for that.
