## Story

This is the official story of Diddi. Some of these stories have been published in videogames, and others
are ideas for in-development games.

### Hired by Yoshyyk

Diddi made his first act as a hero when he defeated a hacker in-person. The Yoshyyk Alliance noticed
this, and decided to hire him to fight crime. He was taken to planet Minecraftalia to be trained.

After that, he joined the Diamond House and the Emerald House (two Yoshyyk factions), and then joined
the elite group, the Netherite Order.

### Diddi vs. Bugs

Diddi didn't return to Earth while he trained, but then he decided to return when noticed a giant invassion
of bugs, bacteria and viruses among the planet's atmosphere.

Diddi used his new starfighter, the Willpower, to destroy them all. After success, he returned to Minecraftalia.

### The Yoshyyk 15th squadron

Diddi founded the 15th squadron of Yoshyyk with some folks. They joined him on several missions.

### The Nether-Ender war

When the Nether and Ender worlds (2 moons from Minecraftalia) entered in conflict, Yoshyyk's squadrons got separated,
and the 15th joined the Ender forces, because the crew was sure that Ender people were innocent.

In that process, the crew was hired by Lord Mendian to take care of his daughter, Lady Alix. Finally, they discovered
the war was a sock puppet from villain Bill Redstone for raising crime in both Nether and Ender.

After the war, Diddi kept working for Lady Alix all the time he wasn't working with his squadron.
