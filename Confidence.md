Like many other ships, the Confidence was built by the Yoshyykians to fight

_The Yoshyykians_ comics show that some Yoshyykians mourn the destruction of the cruise, but doesn't mention
its destruction's reasons at all. According to ["Abandon the ship!"](Abandon_the_Ship), the Confidence was
destroyed by a yet unknown enemy. A few Yoshyykians, including Diddi itself, survived to the misfortune.
