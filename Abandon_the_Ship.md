## Plot

_Sourced from the project's [README](https://github.com/DiddiLeija/abandon-the-ship#readme)_

> Saying "Abandon the ship!" is a quite frequent phrase,
> actually it's considered an old _cliché_...
>
> ...
>
> [Diddi](https://diddileija.github.io/wiki/Diddi), our space tech hero,
> is stuck on a damaged space cruiser, the **Confidence**. Everybody left. The ship was
> attacked a few moments ago, and now it's doomed to destruction.
>
> If Diddi wants to appear on further games and stories, he should "abandon the ship"
> as soon as possible!

## Gameplay

Diddi spawns on a corner of the [Confidence](Confidence). The goal is to reach out the other side,
where the last escape pod is located. On the way, you have to avoid fire and fatal falls.

## Development

### Early development - Submission to GameOff

Diego Ramirez started to develop a game for the [GameOff 2022 jam](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2022).

> The game jam's theme was "cliché"... They also provided a bunch of _clichés_ to get started. I
> wasn't sure of what to do, but then I picked this _cliché_: "Abandon the ship". That's where
> the real development started.
>
> ~ @DiddiLeija

Using a similar strategy from his previous game, [Diddi and the Bugs](Diddi_and_the_Bugs), Ramirez developed
a simple platformer-like game. Then he released it to `itch.io` and the jam. And then, Ramirez launched a 1.0.0
version, which is the "jam version" of the game itself.

The game rank was later published by Ramirez, in his Discord server, as follows:

> Heads up `@everyone`! the results are here... and we rated **202th from 562 submissions!**
>
> ~ @DiddiLeija (quoted from a post in [DiddiLeija's Discord Server](https://discord.gg/DfrHxT9ENy)\)

After that, Ramirez pinned [some goals for improving on a further release](https://github.com/DiddiLeija/abandon-the-ship/issues/6).

### Future

Ramirez is interested on maintaining this game, based in the "jam version"'s feedback.
